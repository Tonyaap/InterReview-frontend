## Goals for this project

---

For this school project [Danny](https://github.com/DannyS-stack) and [Stefan](https://github.com/tonyaap/) teamed up to create a full-stack TypeScript App. Our assignment was to make an App for our fellow students to help them land an awesome job.

These were the goals we wanted to achieve : 

- Practice full-stack app development
- Build a working prototype in 1 day
- Apply the things i've learned in the bootcamp
- Learn and use and implement TypeScript
- Practice development skills like:

  - Making wireframes
  - Data model design
  - Write user stories
  - Use git version control

  ***

  ## User stories

  ***

- As a user I want to: signup with a name and e-mail.
- As a user I want  to: login with my email and a password.
- As a user I want to: be able to review my interviews so i can reflect and improve my performance.
- As a user I want to: asses myself on each interview by filling in a form.
- As a user I want to: be able to see my past interviews
- As a user I want to: see my scores in a Graph so i can visualize my progression.
- As a user I want to: see my average scores and interview stats.

## Git version control

How we've used Git.

- Write clear commit messages
- Name branches by feature
- do pull requests with clear summaries

## Backend server repo

For the backend we've used an Express server with TypeScript and used Sequelize to manage the Postgress database.
